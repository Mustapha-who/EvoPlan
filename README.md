## Usage üöÄ

To run and use EvoPlan :

1. **Start the application**:
   - Run the main class using Maven (replace `com.example.Main` with the actual main class):
     ```bash
     mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
     ```
   - Alternatively, build a JAR and run it:
     ```bash
     mvn package
     java -jar target/hexatech-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```
   - The backend runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default (adjust port if different).

2. **Access the API**:
   - Test API endpoints (e.g., `/api/events`) using **Postman** or **curl**.
   - Example request:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:8080/api/events
     ```
   - Check `src/main/resources/api-docs/` (if available) for API documentation.

3. **Integrate with frontend**:
   - Connect to the EvoPlanWeb frontend or a custom client to manage healthcare events via the API.
